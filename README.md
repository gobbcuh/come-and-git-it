## 🛠️ Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to practice:
- 🌀 Initializing a Git repository  
- ✍️ Writing and committing code  
- 📤 Pushing a project to GitHub  
- 🧩 Understanding the basics of version control

## 🖩 About the Program

This calculator program is **extremely basic** and was created as part of the workshop. It performs simple operations such as:
- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  

> **Note:** This program is not intended to be a fully-featured calculator but rather serves as an exercise to demonstrate GitHub workflows.

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Using the Terminal or Command Prompt  
1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine. Open your terminal (on Linux/Mac) or command prompt (on Windows) and run:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory** containing the program:  
   ```bash
   cd <repository-folder-name>
   ```
3. **Compile the program** using the GCC compiler (ensure GCC is installed):  
   ```bash
   gcc calculator.c -o calculator
   ```
4. **Run the program**:  
   ```bash
   ./calculator
   ```

> **Note:** If you're on Windows, use tools like Git Bash or WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). Alternatively, any terminal with a GCC-compatible environment will work.

### Option 2: Using Visual Studio (Windows)  
1. Open **Visual Studio** and create a new project.  
2. Select **Empty Project** and name it (e.g., `SimpleCalculator`).  
3. Copy and paste the `calculator.c` file into the **Source Files** folder in the Solution Explorer.  
4. Right-click the project name in Solution Explorer and choose **Set as Startup Project**.  
5. Build and run the project by pressing `Ctrl + F5`.  

---

### Option 3: Using an IDE (e.g., Code::Blocks, Dev-C++, CLion)  
1. Open your preferred IDE and create a new project.  
2. Import or add the `calculator.c` file to the project.  
3. Build the project using the IDE's **Build** or **Compile** option.  
4. Run the project from the IDE.
